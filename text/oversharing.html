<body>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Welcome to a look at a piece that took up over a full year of my life. I’ve tried to make this document fun to read while also following a vaguely academic format while I explore my thoughts on I Love Or Hate Everyday, a durational art piece that took place on Instagram throughout 2022-2023.</p>
<p>This document will likely be updated and revised multiple times before I decide enough is enough and just post the thing to my website. It’s worth noting, much of this is unfiltered. I wanted a very honest and direct account of the work, that takes into account elements of its creation that can be rather heavy. If you’d rather avoid that level of insight then it’s best not to keep reading.</p>
<p>If you are reading this, thank you. If you supported the work during its creation, thank you. If you click off this, admittedly overlong, explanation of my Instagram selfies, thank you.</p>
<p>A variable amount of love, Kat</p>
